So you decide that you want to give shooting film a try, but where do you start?
Well, first you need a camera. You jump on the interwebs and quickly realize
that there are about a billion film cameras out there and they’re all different!
Have no fear. I will be your guide into the dense thicket that is the wonderful
world of film cameras.

This Thursday, come on over to Cheviot in the Pleasance where we will be talking
about all of the different types of film cameras and how to find your perfect
film camera! It doesn't matter if you've never even taken a photo before or
you're an avid film photographer, after the lecture, a form will be made
available to you to that will point you towards your ideal film camera!

See you all there!

Presented by Bo Williams, your in-house analog camera guru.
