Photosoc are encouraging you to send in your images to participate in a photo critique session! All images will be printed as 6x4 inch prints, and available for you to collect on the night. Come along to see some of the great work from our members, and get feedback on your own work!

Please send up to 2 images to photosoc.ed@gmail.com with the subject "Photo Review Session". We would prefer you to submit images with a 3:2 aspect ratio as this will produce the best printing results (and we won't have to crop your images!).

*The deadline for submissions is Wednesday 7th February at 12pm!*

This event is free for members and has a Â£1 entry fee for non-members.
