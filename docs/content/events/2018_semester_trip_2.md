The next location of our trip has been decided. This time it would be a two-night trip to Isle of Mull just before Easter!
From the rugged ridges of Ben More and the black basalt crags of Burg to the blinding white sand, rose-pink granite and emerald waters that fringe the Ross, Mull can lay claim to some of the finest and most varied scenery in the Inner Hebrides. Noble birds of prey soar over mountain and coast, while the western waters provide good whale-watching. Add a lovely waterfront 'capital', an impressive castle, the sacred island of Iona and easy access from Oban.

## How to participate
1. Pay £35 for 2-night accommodation (£17.5 per night).
  It has to be paid in CASH to one of our member
  (contact Xiaobei Chen on FB/PM us)
  We'll stay at Craignure Bunkhouse.
  This must be done by Thursday, February 22.
  You can't book with this hostel yourself as we have booked the whole hostel. And there is only one hostel near the port on the island!

2. Buy your own train ticket.

  **Url:** TBC <br>
  **Price:** £46-67

  Price depends when you purchase the ticket and whether you have a railcard. It is advisable that you purchase as early as possible.
  You can buy a different time ticket and travel to join us at the hostel yourself (Please inform us in advance).
  The ticket is a Rail&Sail ticket, meaning both train ride and ferry are included. It requires a change at Glasgow and a transfer to a ferry at Oban. The railway is one of the most scenic routes in Europe!
